## 1 - How to learn about Touch

"Touch is fun, there is so much good stuff in it." - mark moses 26.07.2022

Touch is a ball sport like any other and thus requires other people and lots of communication. Above all learning to move in the pattern together and writing new knowledge in muscle memory is how one doesn't only gain the knowledge but also performs it.

Ideally the group learns to progress together and experiment in game-like situations. For this one needs to be knowledgeable and open minded. Learning about touch with this book will lead you through the following 5 levels on every one of the moves, patterns and tricks starting in [Chapter 4](4%20-%20Attack%20Moves%2C%20Maneuvers/Readme.md?fileId=1382031).

1. **What to Do**

What does the ball carrier have to do in a quickie? Where does the half stand? What can the defense do to react? When you first hear a song you have no idea where it is headed. When the crescendo comes. When the intro is over. What are the good bits and what is there only to get you to the good bits.

Questions of this type will be addressed with graphics and diagrams.

1. **How to learn it**

Each of the following maneuvers are executed from a foundation of basis skills that can be trained one after the other and combined to lead to the more complex constellations. This slow building process should be used in the training sessions to develop a confidence in the execution and train muscle memory by focusing in every session on basics, like a roll ball, in the process of building to more complex maneuvers like a 3-2-short.

Desconstructing the song. Identifying building blocks like intro verse and refrain that follow each other. Different parts in different orders for different songs

1. **Recognizing it off the field**

Video material of matches with time stamps will be provided so school the recognition of patterns in play.

Hearing a song that reminds you of another song. Maybe beginning to understand what the cloices are that are being taken and that are being left out, deliberatly or not.

1. **Recognizing it on field**

Photos from the players perspective will help to see the less obvious changes on the field.

Being able to play along with the song.

1. **When to follow the pattern and when to change it up.**

The fun part. Taking into account the previous four steps a series of scenarios both at the chalk board and on the pitch will be presented to guide the attacking team to the defenses weaknesses and gaps.

Rocking out and soloing.

Before these specific maneuver-related instructions Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 will cover the Basics of the game and the intrinsic imbalance that is the reason the number of touches a team get per possesion.
