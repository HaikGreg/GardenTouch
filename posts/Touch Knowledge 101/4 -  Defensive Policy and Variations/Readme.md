To stop the other team from scoring the defense has to gain possession of the ball. When you have the ball the other team cannot score and vice versa.

As the defending team you can gain possession by either touching an attacking player who is carrying the ball, who then has to perform a roll ball while you retreat for 7 meters and repeat this process 5 times or by forcing an error before the other team score.

As a rule the defense perspective is reactive and focused on how to best use the attack's choices to get 6 touches or have them perform an error. The only time when the defense would not have to react would be when everyone is perfectly matched up and the attack would move forward straight at the defender. Even then the defense would have to choose to stay in the way.

Beyond the basics of how perform a good touch and "win the ruck", there are two more considerations to take note of. The attack, as will be covered in greater details later, has two different immediate aims depending on where the ball is on the pitch. Broadly speaking when the attack is far away from the scoreline they will drive up the field vertically. When the attack is closer to the scoreline the aim shifts away from progressing to scoring which often results in more horizontal play parallel to the line.

Although the goal of gaining possession remains the same defending against Drives and Line Attacks are very different propositions covered in a subsection each. Given the basic imbalance in touch the defending team has a limited set of tools to defend against an almost infinite set of combinations. For this reason getting the basics right and performing them excellently again and again is not only the route to success in matches but should also be the focus of training defensive positions.
