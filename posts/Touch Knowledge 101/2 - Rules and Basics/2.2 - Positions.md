The player of any touch team will take up symmetrical positions on a Touch field starting with each on Wing on the outside, each on Link leading to two Middles sharing the center. This is mirrored in the opposing team.

To maximize speed when running on to the pass the attacking team will take a V-Formation with the tip formed where the ball is. The Defending team, depending on where on the field they are defengin will try to provide the minimum of necessary resistance to stop the attack from scoreing. The Formation will depend heavily on where on the pitch the game is taking place at any moment. Details on the defensive policy in [Chapter 5](../5%20-%20%20Defensive%20Policy%20and%20Variations.md?fileId=1382302)

Instead of calling left and right in relation to the direction of play a more constant fixpoint is the location on the field in relation to the interchange area or subbox. The middles, links and wingers can thus be diffrentiated by "near side" close to be subbox or "far side" far from the subbox. Since both teams have their interchange areas on opposing sides of the field their perspectived on where the far side and near side are are opposed as well.
