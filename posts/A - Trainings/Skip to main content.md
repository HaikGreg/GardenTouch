20191023 Training in Cologne

with John, Vonnie, Alban, Jeremy and special guest Marcel in Touch Colonia !

​

Warm-up

​

- Classic jogg, knee-high, hopping, "kneel on butt", warm up

​

- Simply jogging in the width of the dirt pitch passing the ball. Passing "flat" (as opposed to parabolic passes not opposed of passing backward and runner coming from deep behind)  first short passes  then longer spin-passes afterwards.

Done it 3 or 4 time (way and back) in total.

​

- Jogging around the pitch in queue, the last one overtaking everyone until he get on the first position and so on again and again.

​

- Players paired facing each other. Players takes the touch then run backwards to the "score line" pulling corner symetrically (right then left, right again...), making "triangles".

​

First drill: Agility

​

- Three players standing in a row (behind each other) something like 2-3 meters apart from each other.  Two players doing the drill  (then rotation).

The player starts jogging toward first "standing man".  Standing man raise the left or right arm and the runner has to run over on the other side. Then second "standing man" does the same and so on... runner has to react and adapt his run.

Runner has got ball in hand just for purpose of running with ball in hands  (in both hands).

​

​

Second drill: Playing a 2 vs 1 (without touch)

​

The classic drill in a 2 vs 1 situation dragging the defender and then passing. 

Reduced pitch made quite "large" to make it easy for Attacking team (on the purpose of training Marcel).

​

​

From here all the drills have been made in a very reduced pitch (a quarter of regular pitch maybe)... did not really pay attention to the coach when he made the pitch...

​

Third drill: Playing a 3 vs 2 (without touch)

​

Same principle as above with three attacker. Attacker in the middle has got the ball. Here the two defenders pick an attacker each and stick on them (quite obvious first). Purpose is to see the "Überzahl" and exploit it with a right timed pass.

​

Then extra difficulties, the defenders are allowed to "not stick to one player" and cut gaps between attackers.

​

Fourth drill: Line attack situation with a 3 vs 2 situation

​

Basically game situation 3 vs 2 using the already trained principles. Only two touches allowed (so turnover on the second touch).

Player with the ball during turnover swaps to new attacking team.

​

Fifth drill: Quickies

​

Quickie practice on a 2 vs 2 situation (on a reduced pitch). Three touches for the attacking team.

​

Focus made on the quickie setup (Marcel paired with Vonnie) as well as the overall speed of execution and the 3 attack options after quickie.

For defense emphasis on the pull corner necessity.

​

And that was it.
